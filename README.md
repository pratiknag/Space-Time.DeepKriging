# Space-Time.DeepKriging  

This repository contains supplementary code for the paper:  
[*Spatio-temporal DeepKriging for Interpolation and Probabilistic Forecasting*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spasta.2023.100773).  

## Overview  

This work introduces **Space-Time.DeepKriging**, a deep neural network (DNN) model designed for **spatio-temporal process interpolation and probabilistic forecasting**. The repository provides code implementations for reproducing key results presented in the paper.
